2025-01-25 : Funny thing observed on the c128
             It seems its slower at running this code.
             Also its running in 1MHz mode, you can change to 2MHz mode using
             POKE 53296,1

Algoritms used
        Bubble Sort:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort-algorithm/
        metzner Sort: https://commodore.bombjack.org/commodore/books.htm

TODO: Check if other sorting algoritms needs to be added
      Cleanup, renumbering 
      Add a routine for validating if the array is sorted.
      Add user input of number of items in array, and Y/N to show result
        Think this is one of the last things to do, and the Y/N to show results
        gives an option of running all tests with no pause for showing the result
        for each algorithm.
      Memory survailance.
        I need to test out different ways of monitoring memory usage.
        Tested some ways in TestFreeMem.bas, but its not good and slow.
