2025-01-25 : Funny thing observed on the c128
             It seems its slower at running this code.
             Also its running in 1MHz mode, you can change to 2MHz mode using
             POKE 53296,1

TODO: Check if other sorting algoritms needs to be added
      Cleanup, renumbering 
      Add a routine for validating if the array is sorted.
      Add user input of number of items in array, and Y/N to show result
        Think this is one of the last things to do, and the Y/N to show results
        gives an option of running all tests with no pause for showing the result
        for each algorithm.
      Found some different ways of generating the array to use in the sorting
        For now I have just put them in as comments, but would perhaps be a good
        idea to implement them.
        Still not sure if it should be so the program can test them all, 
        or if the user should just be allowed to choose witch one to use.
      Memory survailance.
        I need to test out different ways of monitoring memory usage.
        Tested some ways in TestFreeMem.bas, but its not good and slow.
      Exit point in qsort
        I have a problem with the code for qsort in lines 4000-
        Since I was not able to figure out where the code exits
        i have had to print the end information in lines 310 & 320
